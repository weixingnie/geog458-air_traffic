This project is focusing on the airports in the US. In this project, we are
going to examine whether the airport has an air traffic control tower or not. If
there is an air traffic control tower, the plane symbol will be blue, otherwise
it will be red. All of our libraries are from open source softwares like leafet.
These dataset are provided by Professor Bo zhao. In terms of inforamtion, the
reconstruction of map US air traffic control tower shows an interesting aspect of
how traffic control tower being placed and built in the USA. To construct a good
map, we use QGIS softwares to provide the extra access for webmap. Moreover, it
shows that most of the US airports had an non-equal density of air traffic distribution.
